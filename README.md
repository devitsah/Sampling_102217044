##Sampling Techniques for Machine Learning Models

This repository contains a comprehensive Google Colab Notebook that demonstrates the application of various sampling techniques to address class imbalance in datasets. The notebook evaluates the impact of these techniques on multiple machine learning models to identify best practices for handling imbalanced data effectively.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The primary goal is to explore and compare the effects of different sampling techniques on model performance, providing insights into their effectiveness for imbalanced datasets.

ðŸ›  Techniques Implemented
	1.	Oversampling: Enhances the representation of minority classes by increasing their sample size.
	2.	Undersampling: Balances class distribution by reducing majority class samples.
	3.	Systematic Sampling: Selects data points at fixed intervals, ensuring consistent sampling coverage.
	4.	Stratified Sampling: Preserves class proportions in the sampled data to reflect the original distribution.
	5.	Cluster Sampling: Randomly selects clusters (groups) to serve as representative samples.
	6.	Bootstrap Sampling: Draws samples with replacement to generate diverse training datasets.

##Machine Learning Models Evaluated

The following models were tested with each sampling technique to assess their performance and robustness:
	â€¢	Logistic Regression
	â€¢	Decision Tree
	â€¢	Random Forest
	â€¢	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	â€¢	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

 ##Results and Observations
	â€¢	Oversampling: Improved the performance on minority classes, especially for highly imbalanced datasets.
	â€¢	Stratified Sampling: Excelled at maintaining class proportions and delivering consistent results.
	â€¢	Random Forest & Decision Tree: Demonstrated high accuracy and resilience across most techniques.
	â€¢	Cluster Sampling: Was effective when clusters were representative of the datasetâ€™s overall structure.
	â€¢	KNN: Performed well with balanced datasets created through oversampling or stratified sampling.
